      "name": "Cottage On The Stream • Sundance, Utah",
      "shortSummary": "Cottage On The Stream • Sundance, Utah",
      "summary": "Cozy, Rustic, Comfortable Cottage on the Stream.  Everyone loves this cabin and it's charm.  Great space for families and friends to gather.  Children and pet friendly with room to play and run and have a great time. (Pet fees apply).\r\n\r\nLocated at the end of a private road, you're nestled between the stream, tall majestic pine trees and solitude - yet you are five minutes from the Resort at Sundance, the ski lift, hiking, biking, zip line and don't forget the Spa!  Good restaurants.  ",
      "notes": "When you walk to the entrance of The Cottage you will see two trees growing side by side by the front door. Under the front windows in the spring the day lilies are like a sea of yellow gently blowing in the gentle breezes.  There is a bench by the front door and the meadow is alive with creatures big and small.  The turkeys meander through the property pecking at who knows what every day. In the spring the babies hustle behind their mommas.  The deer drink from the stream, hanging out and then disappear in the trees. In the spring the meadow twinkles with butterflies of all colors and the hummingbirds begin looking for nectar.  The plastic flowers in the window box are reminiscent of times and people passed that were the guardians of this place.  ",
      "access": "This entire cabin plus the beautiful deck overlooking the stream are yours to enjoy.",
      "transit": "Sundance Resor is a mere 1.2 miles away.  A super quick drive or nice walk in the summer.  November through April requires four wheel or all wheel drive vehicles.  Please check with the hosts.\r\n\r\nDriveway parks two comfortably and space directly in front of Cabin is available.  \r\nRespectfully request no parking at neighborhing cabins  or in the road.  ",
      "interaction": "Living on the mountain and only a five minute walk away, we are available for any and all questions or concerns you may have.  Just give us a call.",
      "neighbourhood": "You're in the heart of the beautiful Wasatch mountains.  Mount Timpanogas  stands tall over Sundance while gorgeous pine trees are everywhere you look.  Take a seat next to stream, breathe in the mountain air and relax.",
      "space": "The Cottage on the Stream sits at the end of Old Bridge Road amidst the tall pine trees, next to the stream overlooking a meadow. How sweet is that? Secluded in the forest, no main road with traffic or sounds of traffic, you have the illusion of being far, far away.\r\n\r\nThe meadow and the property are big enough to let the kids roam outside and play. Bring along your well behaved canine companion* and everyone have a great play day together. (Read pet guidelines for safety of your pet and compliance with the property and Sundance guidelines).\r\n\r\nThe Cottage is a comfortable place to stay.  The living room has two new Laz-E-Boy power leather recliners plus a very comfortable leather couch, and a couch from the 60s that everyone loves. The wood burning, super efficient fireplace provides the primary heat source and you will enjoy its sights, sounds, heat and warmth without all the work of an open fireplace.  Super easy to start your fire and then keep it going.   Your wood is provided plus instructions for building your fire.  \r\n\r\nThe kitchen is small but mighty. The kitchen window looks directly out onto the stream and multiple tables allow for kid tables, adult tables, outside tables and rail dining. Coffee maker, citrus juicer, griddle for blueberry pancakes, blender, crock pot, pots and pans, dishes are all provided. (Paper plates also). Spices and pantry essentials are also provided. \r\n\r\nThe family room has a twin size day bed/trundle for sleeping 2 and a sleeper sofa.  This is a great place to watch a movie under the snugglies. A table for eating or playing games, plus a cabinet of books, movies, puzzles and games will keep everyone entertained. Lots of windows let in natural light so you feel like you are living outdoors and the back door leads right to the redwood deck. \r\n\r\nUpstairs is amazing. The entire area is devoted to sleeping locations. It is dormitory style (no doors) - see pictures for clarity.  The Queen's Space has a queen bed, with a window at the head of the bed overlooking  the stream.  The middle section is affectionately called the Bedroom of the Six Dwarfs with six twin beds arranged.  Six twin beds are arranged so kids and not so little kids can be close enough for midnight whispers but not so close they are cramped. The King Den features a king size bed, a rocking chair by the window and a baby crib if needed. Two windows brings in the morning sun, the nighttime moon and the sounds of the stream. \r\n\r\nThe redwood deck with the top rail designed for dining,  tables and chairs and the hot tub give everyone space be together.   There's a mini bridge for crossing the stream plus a fallen tree that invites you to walk across or sit in the middle and contemplate. \r\n\r\nThe Cottage is minutes by car and walking distance to Sundance Resort and the ski slopes, spa, restaurants and evening entertainment at the Owl Bar. A list of ongoing and current events at Sundance will be provided to help make your stay enjoyable. You really never have to leave the mountain. However, if you love the Best Snow on Earth and want to visit the other ski resorts, you are 45 minutes to Park City, Deer Valley and The Canyons. 60 minutes to Alta, Snow Bird, Brighton and Solitude. \r\n\r\nThe property has plenty of parking. \r\n\r\nAs is typical for all Utah winter mountain driving, access may require 4-wheel drive or chains on a 2-whell drive vehicle between November 1st and March 31st.  \r\n\r\nCancellation Policy: If written notice of cancellation is received by 5:00 MST, 30 days prior to reservation check in date, we will refund a full deposit less a $50 cancellation fee and a 3.4% processing fee. No refunds are offered for cancellations with less than 30 days notification, or 60 days for the winter holiday seasonal pricing. Check outs prior to the reserved dates are not eligible for a refund. A valid credit card will be kept on file for any damages, missing items or excessive cleaning.",

      "summary": "Located along the historic Paiute Trail in Utah’s Tushar Mountains, in the Eagle Point Ski Resort off of Hwy 153, our Mountain Cabins Utah Condos are true diamonds in the most spectacular rough!\r\n\r\nOur Snowflake #15 is a beautiful ski-in/ski-out 2 bedroom, two bath, plus loft condo that sleeps 10 people.  A Queen bed in each bedroom, two twin bed bunk beds in the loft, and a sleeper sofa for 2 in the living room.  Internet access, satellite TV plus a Blu-ray player is there for you to make your stay more enjoyable and comfortable.    A real wood-burning fireplace with dry wood and fire starters makes things extra cozy and convenient.   There’s floor space for an extra person should they want to bring a sleeping bag.  \r\n\r\nA fully stocked kitchen provides everything you need to make yourself at home—cooking utensils, silverware, pots & pans, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, pizza pan, wine glasses, coffee maker, toaster, blender, dishwasher, and microwave.  You’ll find a starter supply of paper towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap, and trash bags for your use.   \r\n\r\nThe deck has plenty of room to sit outside and enjoy spectacular views of the ski slopes and breathe the clean air with a nice cup of coffee in the morning or a beverage of choice in the evening to watch the sunset or look at the stars.",

      "neighbourhood": "Eagle Point Resort & Area: \r\n Any time of year, there’s no better place to escape the crowds than by booking a Mountain Cabins Utah Condo at Eagle Point Ski Resort. Located in the Fish Lake National Forest, at over 9,000’ above sea level, you can escape the heat of summer and breathe the cleanest air surrounded by tall quakie aspens and pine trees.  In the fall, come and watch the trees turn yellow and feel the crispness of the changing seasons.  In winter the solitude and beauty of the snow is like being in the movies. \r\n\r\nSummertime:  \r\nOur Mountain Cabins Utah Condos provide untethered access to bucket list hiking, world-class fishing, clear water kayaking, paddle-boarding, mind-blowing mountain biking, and miles and miles of ATV trails for exploration, all within minutes of your front door.  Try frisbee golf or paintball at the Upper Eagle Point Lodge or enjoy golf or tennis in Beaver, just 20 minutes down the mountain.  Do you have horses?  Bring them up and ride the trails.  We have space for horse trailers and areas for you to tether them.   \r\n\r\nDon’t forget your camera equipment because this is one of the most Instagram-worthy experiences you’ll ever find.  There’s truly no shortage of amazing sights and experiences to share with your followers over your Mountain Cabins Utah Condo and Eagle Point Ski Resort vacation (tag us @mtcabinsut and show other guests around using #mtcabinsutguest and #mtcabinsutguide)\r\n\r\n\r\nFires:  \r\nOpen flame fires are not permitted anywhere on the property.  Be very mindful of the level of forest fire danger. Remember Smokey the Bear - ONLY YOU can prevent forest fires.  \r\n\r\nWintertime: World-class skiing and snowboarding on the greatest snow on earth at Eagle Point Ski Resort is hard to beat. With access to 650 skiable acres and 40 named runs, ranging from tree-lined groomers to the steepest, most challenging runs in southern Utah, Eagle Point’s 5 lifts will provide each skill level of skier or snowboarder in your group with a fun-filled, action-packed day.  From the base elevation of 9,100’ to the summit elevation of 10,600’ there’s 1,500’ of elevation.  The small crowds, reasonable lift pricing, expert terrain, and spectacular views are unbeatable. \r\n\r\nThe national forest lands surrounding Eagle Point Ski Resort are your playground for snowmobiling, timber sledding, and snow biking.  (Not permitted within the boundaries of the Resort). \r\n\r\nEndless trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing are also right outside the condos.  Take the little ones out for sledding, make snow angels, make a snowman or engage in a good old-fashioned snowball fight.   Bring your family and teach them how to ski and also get in plenty of verticals for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Terrain Park, located by the Monarch Triple Chair Lift, is an ever-evolving creation of our residential Tzar of Creation, Mongo.  The addition of new snow-making equipment in 2019, created five different jumps and twelve rail features.  Come and try those tricks you saw on television and were told not to try at home.  Well, you’re not at home now, are you?  However, a bit of prudence and common sense might be a good rule of thumb. \r\n\r\nAfter a day on the slopes, enjoy a cup of hot cocoa by the warm fireplace (wood supplied) as you look out over the resort and let the memories you’re building really sink in and find a permanent home in your heart.  Or, let someone else do all the work and simply go to the Canyon Side Lodge to enjoy a fantastic meal with the family or a quiet wine or beverage in the bar. \r\n\r\nWinter Survival:  It is absolutely mandatory to drive vehicles with four-wheel or all-wheel drive, or you must have chains that you know how to put on.   In your parking space in front of the condo with your front-facing into the parking lot for easy exit.  Put your windshield wipers up away from the window for easier cleaning.  The snowplows usually come once a day in the morning.  HINT:  Remember in heavy snow, do not try to power your way out if you sense you are getting stuck.  Move forward a few inches, then back a few inches.  Slow and steady.  Never come up the mountain without a full tank of gas.  Never. \r\n\r\nFalling Snow and Ice:  Look up and be aware of what’s over your head.  Stairs can be very slippery and dangerous.  Wear appropriate shoes and clothing.  \r\n\r\nAt Your Condo:  Please do your part to conserve water and electricity that isn’t being used.  Please keep the doors and windows or screens closed to ensure the wildlife stays wild and you don’t.\r\n\r\nTrash: If you have a lot of trash there is a dumpster on the left as you head to upper Eagle Point Lodge. There is also a dumpster available to the public near the mouth of Beaver Canyon.\r\n\r\nPlease, NO SMOKING in the Condos.\r\n\r\nEntertainment:  While there is internet and satellite TV in Snowflake 15, we find that most guests come here to unplug and be entertained by the real greatest show on earth, Mother Nature.  Your home away from home has family games and books.  A Blue-Ray Player is available so bring your favorite movies to watch or that book you’ve wanted to read.  Cuddle up on the couch with a blanket and pillow and take an hour or two for yourself.  \r\n\r\nCell service is spotty so you’ll want to enable WiFi calling if you need to keep in touch with the world below.\r\n\r\nLocal Attractions:  Puffer Lake, 1.5 miles from the condo, is the nearest of nine lakes near the condo.  Plenty of fishing is available in the lakes or the many streams and rivers that flow through the area.  A half-day driving excursion on FR 135 off of Hwy 135 will acquaint you with all nine lakes and get you out in the stunningly beautiful forest and meadows. \r\n\r\nGroceries and Supplies:  Mike’s Food Town, is located at 270 N Main Street in Beaver. Stock up on essentials at Mike’s before you come up the mountain. SUGGESTION:  Stop at bigger stores for your specialty items in Cedar City if you’re coming from the south or Spanish Fork if coming from the north or do your major shopping at home.  Mike and his family have been the local grocer since 1980. \r\n\r\nAdult Beverage:  Beaver Spirits, is located at 710 N Main Street in Beaver.  Small but nice wine selection and also have great t-shirts for sale.  \r\n\r\nFavorite Shops:   \r\n***Sherwood Forest Candle & Gift Shop, (435) 438-0211\r\n31 N Main Street, Beaver, Utah 84713\r\n\r\n***This is where you can purchase the \"Cup of Fire\" fire starters used in our condo.\r\n\r\nBeaver Sport and Pawn, (435) 438-0211\r\n91 N Main St, Beaver, UT 84713\r\nThis is a “just because you have to see it”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Creamery, (833) 796-4551\r\n165 South 500 West, Beaver, UT 84713\r\nGifts, ice cream, cheese and more\r\n\r\nRestaurants:\r\nOn the mountain:  \r\n\r\nThe Canyonside Bar & Grill serves Friday dinner service and Saturday lunch and dinner service mid-June through Labor Day Weekend.  \r\n\r\nBeaver Area:  Maria’s Cocina (17 miles away at 1419 E Canyon Rd. - 435-438-5654) is our absolute favorite, must-try restaurant.  Opens Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day Weekend.   Quaint Mexican Restaurant with Maria, herself, cooking in the back. Have to try it.  \r\n\r\nOur Local Favorites: Beaver Taco, Craigo’s Pizza , the Timberline - for nice dine-in, Mel’s Diner for great burgers and shakes and The Creamery Cheese Factory.  And don’t forget Dairy Queen for dessert! \r\n\r\nGatherings:   Mountain Cabins Utah Condos own a total of six condominiums in Eagle Point Ski Resort.  For your larger gatherings of groups or family and friends, consider renting multiple condos to sleep a total of 38 people in a total of 19 beds (including sleeper sofas).\r\n\r\nLarger groups are no problem, just let us know and we’ll arrange everything for you.  How about that big family reunion waiting to happen, a beautiful destination wedding, corporate retreats/events, church functions, group trail rides, and hikes.  The ideas are endless but you can count on Mountain Cabins Utah Condos and Eagle Point Ski Resort to help you facilitate your biggest dreams.  ",

Located in a resort that takes you back to a time when fun was plentiful, lift lines were minimal or non-existent, and nature was more valuable than electronics.\r\n\r\nLocated along the historic Paiute Trail in Utah’s Tushar Mountains, in the Eagle Point Ski Resort off of Hwy 153, our Mountain Cabins Utah Condos are true diamonds in the most spectacular rough!\r\nOur Snowflake #17 is a beautiful ski-in/ski-out 2 bedroom, two-bath condo with a loft that sleeps 11 people.  A  Queen bed in each of the bedrooms, a corner unit bunk bed system in the loft sleeps 5 (including a trundle) plus a sleeper sofa for 2 in the living room!.  Everybody has a place to sleep.   Internet access, satellite TV plus a Blu-ray player is there for you to make your stay more enjoyable and comfortable.    A real wood-burning fireplace with dry wood and fire starters makes things extra cozy and convenient.   \r\n\r\nFully equipped kitchen including cooking utensils, silverware, pots & pans, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, pizza pan, wine glasses, coffee maker, toaster, blender, dishwasher, and microwave.  You’ll find a starter supply of paper towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap, and trash bags for your use.   \r\n\r\nThe deck has plenty of room to sit outside and enjoy spectacular views of the ski slopes and breathe the clean air with a nice cup of coffee in the morning or a beverage of choice in the evening to watch the sunset or look at the stars.",

      "neighbourhood": "Eagle Point Resort & Area:  Any time of year, there’s no better place to escape the crowds than by booking a Mountain Cabins Utah Condo at Eagle Point Ski Resort. Located in the Fish Lake National Forest, at over 9,000’ above sea level, you can escape the heat of summer and breathe the cleanest air surrounded by tall quakie aspens and pine trees.  In the fall, come and watch the trees turn yellow and feel the crispness of the changing seasons.  In winter the solitude and beauty of the snow is like being in the movies. \r\n\r\nSummertime:  Our Mountain Cabins Utah Condos provide untethered access to bucket list hiking, world-class fishing, clear water kayaking, paddle-boarding, mind-blowing mountain biking and miles and miles of ATV trails for exploration, all within minutes of your front door.  Try frisbee golf or enjoy golf or tennis in Beaver, just 20 minutes down the mountain.  Do you have horses?  Bring them up and ride the trails.  We have space for horse trailers and areas for you to tether them.   \r\n\r\nFires:  Open flame fires are not permitted anywhere on the property.  Be very mindful of the level of forest fire danger. Remember Smokey the Bear - ONLY YOU can prevent forest fires.  \r\n\r\nWintertime: World-class skiing and snowboarding on the greatest snow on earth at Eagle Point Ski Resort is hard to beat. With access to 650 skiable acres and 40 named runs, ranging from tree-lined groomers to the steepest, most challenging runs in southern Utah, Eagle Point’s 5 lifts will provide each skill level of skier or snowboarder in your group with a fun-filled, action-packed day.  From the base elevation of 9,100’ to the summit elevation of 10,600’ there’s 1,500’ of elevation.  The small crowds, reasonable lift pricing, expert terrain, and spectacular views are unbeatable. \r\n\r\nThe national forest lands surrounding Eagle Point Ski Resort are your playground for snowmobiling, timber sledding, and snow biking.  (Not permitted within the boundaries of the Resort). \r\n\r\nEndless trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing are also right outside the condos.  Take the little ones out for sledding, make snow angels, make a snowman or engage in a good old-fashioned snowball fight.   Bring your family and teach them how to ski and also get in plenty of verticals for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe addition of new snow-making equipment in 2019, created five different jumps and twelve rail features.  Come and try those tricks you saw on television and were told not to try at home.  Well, you’re not at home now, are you?  However, a bit of prudence and common sense might be a good rule of thumb. \r\n\r\nAfter a day on the slopes, enjoy a cup of hot cocoa by the warm fireplace (wood supplied) as you look out over the resort and let the memories you’re building really sink in and find a permanent home in your heart.  \r\n\r\nWinter Survival:  It is absolutely mandatory to drive vehicles with four-wheel or all-wheel drive, or you must have chains that you know how to put on.   In your parking space in front of the condo with your front-facing into the parking lot for easy exit.  Put your windshield wipers up away from the window for easier cleaning.  The snow plows usually come once a day in the morning.  HINT:  Remember in heavy snow, do not try to power your way out if you sense you are getting stuck.  Move forward a few inches, then backward a few inches.  Slow and steady.  Never come up the mountain without a full tank of gas.  Never. \r\n\r\nFalling Snow and Ice:  Look up and be aware of what’s over your head.  Stairs can be very slippery and dangerous.  Wear appropriate shoes and clothing.  \r\n\r\nAt Your Condo:  Please do your part to conserve water and electricity that isn’t being used.  Please keep the doors and windows or screens closed to ensure the wildlife stays wild and you don’t.\r\n\r\nTrash: If you have a lot of trash there is a dumpster on the left as you head to upper Eagle Point Lodge. There is also a dumpster available to the public near the mouth of Beaver Canyon.\r\n\r\nPlease, NO SMOKING in the Condos.\r\n\r\nEntertainment:  While there is internet and satellite TV in Wooded Ridge #6, we find that most guests come here to unplug and be entertained by the real greatest show on earth, Mother Nature.  Your home away from home has family games and books.  A Blue-Ray Player is available so bring your favorite movies to watch or that book you’ve wanted to read.  Cuddle up on the couch with a blanket and pillow and take an hour or two for yourself.  \r\n\r\nCell service is spotty so you’ll want to enable WiFi calling if you need to keep in touch with the world below.\r\n\r\nLocal Attractions:  Puffer Lake, 1.5 miles from the condo, is the nearest of nine lakes near the condo.  Plenty of fishing is available in the lakes or the many streams and rivers that flow through the area.  A half-day driving excursion on FR 135 off of Hwy 135 will acquaint you with all nine lakes and get you out in the stunningly beautiful forest and meadows. \r\n\r\nGroceries and Supplies:  Mike’s Food Town, is located at 270 N Main Street in Beaver. Stock up on essentials at Mike’s before you come up the mountain. SUGGESTION:  Stop at bigger stores for your specialty items in Cedar City if you’re coming from the south or Spanish Fork if coming from the north or do your major shopping at home.  Mike and his family have been the local grocer since 1980. \r\n\r\nAdult Beverage:  Beaver Spirits, is located at 710 N Main Street in Beaver.  Small but nice wine selection and also have great t-shirts for sale.  \r\n\r\nFavorite Shops:   \r\n***Sherwood Forest Candle & Gift Shop, (435) 438-0211\r\n31 N Main Street, Beaver, Utah 84713\r\n\r\n***This is where you can purchase the \"Cup of Fire\" fire starters used in our condo.\r\n\r\nBeaver Sport and Pawn, (435) 438-0211\r\n91 N Main St, Beaver, UT 84713\r\nThis is a “just because you have to see it”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Creamery, (833) 796-4551\r\n165 South 500 West, Beaver, UT 84713\r\nGifts, ice cream, cheese and more\r\n\r\nRestaurants:\r\nOn the mountain:  \r\n\r\nThe Canyonside Bar & Grill serves Friday dinner service and Saturday lunch and dinner service mid June through Labor Day Weekend.  \r\n\r\nBeaver Area:  Maria’s Cocina (17 miles away at 1419 E Canyon Rd. - 435-438-5654) is our absolute favorite, must try restaurant.  Opens Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day Weekend.   Quaint Mexican Restaurant with Maria, herself, cooking in the back. Have to try it.  \r\n\r\nOur Local Favorites: Beaver Taco, Craigo’s Pizza , the Timberline - for nice dine-in, Mel’s Diner for great burgers and shakes and The Creamery Cheese Factory.  And don’t forget Dairy Queen for desert! \r\n\r\nGatherings:   Mountain Cabins Utah Condos own a total of six condominiums in Eagle Point Ski Resort.  For your larger gatherings of groups or family and friends, consider renting multiple condos to sleep a total of 38 people in a total of 19 beds (including sleeper sofas).\r\n\r\nLarger groups are no problem, just let us know and we’ll arrange everything for you.  How about that big family reunion waiting to happen, a beautiful destination wedding, corporate retreats/events, church functions, group trail rides, and hikes.  The ideas are endless but you can count on Mountain Cabins Utah Condos and Eagle Point Ski Resort to help you facilitate your biggest dreams.  ",

      "summary": "Stream Song is an exceptionally warm, inviting cabin for reconnecting with family and friends.  Take it easy here.  Play games at the dining room table, watch a movie on the Smart TV, make a meal with friends or just sit on the deck and listen to the year-round song of the stream below.  Breathe the fresh mountain air.  For a treat, take a drink of our fresh out of the faucet drinking water!  Crystal clean.  \r\n\r\nThis five bedroom, four bathroom home is a two-minute drive to the ski slopes, restaurants, and spa at  the Resort.  Centered in the middle of the open concept entry way, living room, dining room and kitchen is a large propane fireplace making everything so cozy.  The chic, mountain cabin furnishings are comfortable and invite relaxation.  \r\n\r\nThe wonderful floor to ceiling windows allows natural light in and showcases the views of the forest, majestic Mt. Timpanogas, gorgeous skies and the natural abundance of beauty this little slice of heaven here in Sundance, Utah, provides.   A well-appointed kitchen has updated appliances with counter space.  It is a joy to cook and prepare meals.  \r\n\r\n Two bedrooms on the main level feature queen beds with windows for light. One bedroom has a workstation desk, with direct access to one of two bathrooms closely situated.  The second bedroom has a ladder that accesses a quiet reading space when you might just want to \"hide out\".  A full-size washer and dryer are located on this floor for your convenience. \r\n\r\nUpstairs is the master suite with king size bed, private fireplace, outside balcony and a bathroom with a window walled tub overlooking the landscape. The Nap Nook is on this level as well. Great excuse to take a nap! \r\n\r\nThe lower level is an open area featuring twin beds at one end for the kids and a workout area with stationary bike, free weights, a bench, and a TV.  A second private bedroom on this floor has an adjacent bathroom featuring a queen bed and sitting area.  \r\n\r\nThe main level deck features (weather permitting) a dining table, Adirondack chairs and a propane BBQ for grilling.  At the opposite end of the deck is the covered hot tub with a separate entrance from the house to make winter access easy. \r\n\r\nWe would love to share this magical place with you.  Come make Stream Song your home away from home for your next get away.\r\n\r\nNO PETS – NO PARTIES OR EVENTS\r\nDRIVEWAY PARKING FOR FIVE CARS.   \r\n",

This is where you want to be.",

Although we are not affiliated with the Resort itself, all activities and amenities are available for your use.  \r\n\r\nTimpCreek is not a private stand alone structure and has another rental attached to it.  Each unit has it's own very separate private entrance and all TimpCreek’s decks, hot tub and space are all yours to use.",

Be mindful from November 1st until March 31st you will need to drive a four wheel or all wheel vehicle.  \r\n\r\nThere are no grocery stores or gas stations at Sundance however in the directions, we give the location of the stores closest to us.",

      "neighbourhood": "As you walk out the path from the cabin, turn left and and on your walk to the Resort, you have two options, both same distance.  When you get to the fork, go left and you will pass the Glass Blowers (seasonal), and the Art Gallery for great gifts or drop in and sign up for any of their classes such as pottery,  jewelry making, journal making or shop for great gifts.   \r\n\r\nTurn right at the fork, and you wll walk past the Private Screening Room, the pond with beautiful 18\" inch trout and then walk over to the base of the Outlaw Ski Lift.\r\n\r\nFor a visit to the Spa, as you come out of the cabin turn to your right and walk up the stairs to Timphaven Road.  The Spa is located just a short walk on the right side of Timphaven.",

      "neighbourhood": "You're in the heart of the beautiful Wasatch mountains.  Mount Timpanogas  stands tall over Sundance while tall pine trees are everywhere you look.  Take a seat next to stream, breathe in the mountain air and relax.",
      "space": "The Treehouse has separate levels and functions well for couples traveling together or for kids who want their own space. Upper level has beds for five and a sleeper sofa for two. The lower level has a queen bed for two plus sleeper sofa. Total sleeping space in beds is seven, eleven including sleeper sofas. \r\n\r\nThe main level has a real wood burning fireplace, fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer with ample closets and televisions with satellite service including premium movie channels. The large windows and decks look through the trees at the steam. The kitchen deck invites you to enjoy early morning beverages in the peace and quiet while you breathe in the fresh mountain air to start your day or sip a cocktail in the evening and ponder the stars at night. The main deck allows for all day lounging and listening to the stream, or watching the kids enjoy the swings and play in their own treehouse during the summer or make snow angels or snowball fight in the winter. There is plenty of room for exploring the area and letting the kids be kids. After all, a cabin is just a cabin, but combined with room to go outside and play is a great treat. \r\n\r\nThe master bedroom has a full size closet and a dresser to provide plenty of room for unpacking, leading to a feeling of belonging not afforded by living out of a suitcase. \r\n\r\nThe second bedroom bunk beds feature a full size bed on the bottom and a twin on top. An armoire with large drawers allows you to unpack and feel at home. This bedroom contains the washer/dryer closet and shelves housing extra towels and household supplies. \r\n\r\nThe lower level has a separate entrance with a gas fireplace with a thermostat and remote control. The living room features one of the best sleeper sofas and is cozy, comfortable and fun. The big windows look out onto the deck and lawn. The kitchenette area is equipped with mini fridge, toaster/convection oven, two burner hot plate, microwave, pots and pans and serving ware. The queen size bed sits beside a large window looking out into the forest at ground level. Great for catching the squirrels at play, turkeys on their daily treks and even deer that wander close to the house. Got kids needing their own space? This is it. Check out the trap door with ladder for going upstairs and down. Kids love this! \r\n\r\nThe lower level deck has an Instagram worthy porch swing, you'll enjoy reconnecting with each other in, while. the living room has HD TV with satellite programming including premium movies, so you'll have the best of all options. \r\n\r\nThe treehouse has board games and more. For your convenience, we supply paper towels, toilet paper, Kleenix, bath soap, shampoo & conditioner, dishwasher detergent and laundry detergent.\r\n\r\nThe Treehouse has a large grassy area for walking to the edge of the stream to cool your feet after a hike in the summer or laying on your back looking at the clouds roll by. We affectionately call this beachfront property! In the winter, this same area covered with snow is perfect for making snow angels, building snowmen or watching the creation of beautiful ice masterpieces in the stream. The bridge crossing the stream is enjoyable either season and is great place to stage those memorable photos of your family and friends. \r\n\r\nTrails that never leave the property or meander up the hills and through the woods, room to throw a ball and play hide and seek or just find a rock to sit on - you can do it at the Treehouse property. No main roads mean no traffic or traffic sounds and affords you the sounds of the forest. \r\n\r\nThe Treehouse is minutes by car and within walking distance of Sundance Resort. Ski slopes, spa, restaurants, evening entertainment at the Owl Bar with live music on weekend nights provides the opportunity to check back in when you want. A list of ongoing and current events at Sundance is available  to help make your stay enjoyable. You really never have to leave the mountain. However, if you love the Best Snow on Earth and want to visit the other ski resorts you are 45 minutes to Park City, Deer Valley & The Canyons. 60 minutes to Alta, Snow Bird, Brighton and Solitude.\r\n\r\nThis property has plenty of parking and if you want to bring along Aunt Suzy and Uncle Bill and their RV, ask about the availability of our RV space. This space is only steps from the main house and has access to the stream and room for private space as well. \r\n\r\nAs is typical for all Utah winter mountain driving, access may require 4-wheel drive or chains on a 2-wheel drive vehicle.",
