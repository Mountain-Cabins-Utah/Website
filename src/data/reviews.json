There is plenty of supplies and kitchen equipment to whip up a snack or quick bite for breakfast and even a BBQ grill on one of the magnificent covered decks.   Pamela and Lynn are attentive and available hosts without invading your privacy.   I will definitely be back and will not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family!",

The location next to Sundance Resort (5 minute walk) opened all its activities, restaurants and shopping to us, which gave us plenty to do and enjoy. This is a top-notch vacation experience for us, and we have had many to compare it with on several continents. We will return regularly. ",

The setting is so peaceful, relaxing, and rejuvenating. And Pamela is a consummate host. Everything we needed, and more, was at our fingertips, it seems. Our children and grandchildren loved both cabins, and the Carriage House is the perfect place to catch up on a few winks in the afternoon, sit on the bridge and watch the stream tumble over the rocks, view the wild turkeys (and even call to them and listen for them to answer), watch the hawks and eagles soar in the sky, listen to the chipmunks and squirrels, or look for shapes in the clouds soaring overhead. We loved every minute, and wish we could have stayed longer.",
