The sleeper/sofa is not only comfortable for sitting but is so easy to open into a queen size bed you’ll be surprised.  (Sheets, blankets and pillows are provided).  A bistro table with two chairs welcomes you to drink coffee in the morning, work on your laptop (if needed) or just have a conversation with someone while looking out at the mountain side.  \n\nNew carpet in the bedroom has a queen size bed, night stands with dual USB ports for charging your devices, sliding glass doors to the deck (with light darkening draperies) with linens, pillows and blankets provided.  Then there’s the bathroom…..heated radiant floors, heated towel rack, lit and dimmable vanity mirror with de-fogger, hair dryer, gives this a spa feel while you soak in the tub after a days adventure in the outdoors \n\nThen there’s the kitchen.
