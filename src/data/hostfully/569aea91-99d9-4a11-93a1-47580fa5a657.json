Eventually, he and his sons Scott and John, surveyed their way up the North Fork of the Provo River to within a few hundred yards of this place. Like everyone else that has seen the majesty of Mount Timpanogos, the Stewarts were taken with its beauty and wondered at the possibilities offered by this land. \n\nThe Homestead Act of 1860 allowed individuals to claim 140 acres each, on the condition that they improve the land. They did so by creating a timber mill, harvesting ice and farming beets, among other things. The land was eventually consolidated into the hands of Scott and John.  By the 1930’s Scott’s son Paul purchased his father’s share of the land. It became the summer range for his sheep. Every year, after the snow melted, he drove his sheep from the desert west of Utah Lake, up Provo Canyon, to graze on the grasses offered by these mountains. \n\nThe first home on this property was built by Paul with salvaged wood from his parent’s cabin at Aspen Grove, that was destroyed by an avalanche. This enabled Paul to be near his sheep and his wife Hilda and their eight children. A painting of that cabin hangs on the wall next to the entry to the kitchen of this cabin.  It housed Paul, Hilda and their children through many summers. In 1945, Paul’s brothers Ray and Hank asked to install a 1,000 foot rope to an old Chevy truck engine to pull skiers up the hill. Later, Paul bought an old chair lift from an operation at Parley’s Summit, near Park City and had it installed on his property. That was the beginning of what would become the Timp Haven ski resort. \n\nBy the late 1960’s Paul was looking to sell the ski resort. He found a buyer in a young actor that first showed up at Timp Haven in 1962 on his way home from college in Colorado. Later, the actor met and married a girl from Orem. He purchased property from John Stewart and built a cabin on the property. By 1969, Paul and Robert Redford reached a deal, and the resort was renamed “Sundance.” \n\nSome of the history laid out here can be viewed in picture form on the wall between the Tree Room Restaurant and the deli. You can also see pictures of the Timp Haven resort on the walls of the Outlook Café. Other reminders of this history and heritage still exist in the rock fireplace standing out front at the bottom of the stairs. It was the fireplace that stood at the center of the family room of that first home. \n\nThis cabin was built in 1978. Paul and Hilda’s children and grandchildren have worked hard to maintain and preserve it in its original state. If the majestic pines that stand on either side of this cabin could speak, they could tell more history than can be shared here. They could tell us of the many happy times and fond memories enjoyed by Paul, Hilda and their descendants. We hope you enjoy your time here and appreciate all those who have come before to make this experience possible. \n",
