Queen bed in each bedroom, two  sets of twin size bed bunk beds in the loft, and a sleeper sofa for 2 in the living room.  Internet access, smart TVs,  is there for you to make your stay more enjoyable and comfortable.    A real wood-burning fireplace with dry wood and fire starters makes things extra cozy and convenient.   \n\n",
    "notes": "Located along the historic Paiute Trail in Utah’s Tushar Mountains, in the Eagle Point Ski Resort off of Hwy 153, our Mountain Cabins Utah Condos are true diamonds in the most spectacular rough!\n\nA fully stocked kitchen provides everything you need to make yourself at home—cooking utensils, silverware, pots & pans, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, pizza pan, wine glasses, coffee maker, toaster, blender, dishwasher, and microwave.  You’ll find a starter supply of paper towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap, and trash bags for your use.   \n\nThe deck has plenty of room to sit outside and enjoy spectacular views of the ski slopes and breathe the clean air with a nice cup of coffee in the morning or a beverage of choice in the evening to watch the spectacular sunsets or look at the stars.",

    "transit": "Winter driving requires four wheel or all wheel drive vehicles.  Come prepared!  ",

    "neighbourhood": "Any time of year, there’s no better place to escape the crowds than by booking a Mountain Cabins Utah Condo at Eagle Point Ski Resort. Located in the Fish Lake National Forest, at over 9,000’ above sea level, you can escape the heat of summer and breathe the cleanest air surrounded by tall quakie aspens and pine trees.  In the fall, come and watch the trees turn yellow and feel the crispness of the changing seasons.  In winter the solitude and beauty of the snow is like being in the movies. \n\nSummertime:  \nOur Mountain Cabins Utah Condos provide untethered access to bucket list hiking, world-class fishing, clear water kayaking, paddle-boarding, mind-blowing mountain biking, and miles and miles of ATV trails for exploration, all within minutes of your front door.  Try frisbee golf or paintball at the Upper Eagle Point Lodge or enjoy golf or tennis in Beaver, just 20 minutes down the mountain.  Do you have horses?  Bring them up and ride the trails.  We have space for horse trailers and areas for you to tether them.   \n\nDon’t forget your camera equipment because this is one of the most Instagram-worthy experiences you’ll ever find.  There’s truly no shortage of amazing sights and experiences to share with your followers over your Mountain Cabins Utah Condo and Eagle Point Ski Resort vacation (tag us @mtcabinsut and show other guests around using #mtcabinsutguest and #mtcabinsutguide)\n\n\nFires:  \nOpen flame fires are not permitted anywhere on the property.  Be very mindful of the level of forest fire danger. Remember Smokey the Bear - ONLY YOU can prevent forest fires.  \n\nWintertime: World-class skiing and snowboarding on the greatest snow on earth at Eagle Point Ski Resort is hard to beat. With access to 650 skiable acres and 40 named runs, ranging from tree-lined groomers to the steepest, most challenging runs in southern Utah, Eagle Point’s 5 lifts will provide each skill level of skier or snowboarder in your group with a fun-filled, action-packed day.  From the base elevation of 9,100’ to the summit elevation of 10,600’ there’s 1,500’ of elevation.  The small crowds, reasonable lift pricing, expert terrain, and spectacular views are unbeatable. \n\nThe national forest lands surrounding Eagle Point Ski Resort are your playground for snowmobiling, timber sledding, and snow biking.  (Not permitted within the boundaries of the Resort). \n\nEndless trails for snowshoeing or cross-country skiing are also right outside the condos.  Take the little ones out for sledding, make snow angels, make a snowman or engage in a good old-fashioned snowball fight.   Bring your family and teach them how to ski and also get in plenty of verticals for yourself.\n\nThe Terrain Park, located by the Monarch Triple Chair Lift, is an ever-evolving creation of our residential Tzar of Creation, Mongo.  The addition of new snow-making equipment in 2019, created five different jumps and twelve rail features.  Come and try those tricks you saw on television and were told not to try at home.  Well, you’re not at home now, are you?  However, a bit of prudence and common sense might be a good rule of thumb. \n\nAfter a day on the slopes, enjoy a cup of hot cocoa by the warm fireplace (wood supplied) as you look out over the resort and let the memories you’re building really sink in and find a permanent home in your heart.  Or, let someone else do all the work and simply go to the Canyon Side Lodge to enjoy a fantastic meal with the family or a quiet wine or beverage in the bar. \n\nWinter Survival:  It is absolutely mandatory to drive vehicles with four-wheel or all-wheel drive, or you must have chains that you know how to put on.   In your parking space in front of the condo with your front-facing into the parking lot for easy exit.  Put your windshield wipers up away from the window for easier cleaning.  The snowplows usually come once a day in the morning.  HINT:  Remember in heavy snow, do not try to power your way out if you sense you are getting stuck.  Move forward a few inches, then back a few inches.  Slow and steady.  Never come up the mountain without a full tank of gas.  Never. \n\nFalling Snow and Ice:  Look up and be aware of what’s over your head.  Stairs can be very slippery and dangerous.  Wear appropriate shoes and clothing.  \n\nAt Your Condo:  Please do your part to conserve water and electricity that isn’t being used.  Please keep the doors and windows or screens closed to ensure the wildlife stays wild and you don’t.\n\nTrash: If you have a lot of trash there is a dumpster on the left as you head to upper Eagle Point Lodge. There is also a dumpster available to the public near the mouth of Beaver Canyon.\n\nPlease, NO SMOKING in the Condos.\n\nEntertainment:  While there is internet and satellite TV in Snowflake 15, we find that most guests come here to unplug and be entertained by the real greatest show on earth, Mother Nature.  Your home away from home has family games and books.  A Blue-Ray Player is available so bring your favorite movies to watch or that book you’ve wanted to read.  Cuddle up on the couch with a blanket and pillow and take an hour or two for yourself.  \n\nCell service is spotty so you’ll want to enable WiFi calling if you need to keep in touch with the world below.\n\nLocal Attractions:  Puffer Lake, 1.5 miles from the condo, is the nearest of nine lakes near the condo.

Mike and his family have been the local grocer since 1980. \n\nAdult Beverage:  Beaver Spirits, is located at 710 N Main Street in Beaver.
