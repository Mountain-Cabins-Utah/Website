    "interaction": "Time away is so very important and we commit to do everything to make your time stress free.  \nPrior to your arrival we turn lights on, add music to the television and adjust temperatures  to add to a cozy welcome when you enter. \n\nAfter your booking, Pamela, your mountain contact, will send you a text for easier communication and to make sure any urgent message can be communicated to you quickly.  \n\n\n\n",
    "neighbourhood": "Walk out the path from TimpCreek and turn left to go to the Resort.  When you get to the fork, go left again nd you will pass the Glass Blowers (seasonal), the Art Gallery for great gifts or to take a class,   Turn right at the fork and you will walk past the Private Screening Room, the Pond and then find the Outlaw Ski Lift and LookOut Aspre Restaurant o your right and the Resort Restaurants to your left.  \n\nOr, walk out the path from Timp Creek and turn right, walk up the stairs to Timphaven Road.  The Spa is located just a short walk on the right side of Timphaven.",

Set apart, but not remote, TimpCreek on the  Stream has easy all year access.  \n\nCurl up in front of the propane fireplace for a cozy conversation or to read a book.  New classic inspired appliances make preparing a meal a delight and then dine at the dining room table while looking out at Mother Nature.  Should you have to get a bit of work done, there's a desk set up for your convenience.  Then.... go out and play.  \n\nThe kitchen deck with BBQ and table is perfect for outdoor dining.  \n\nMain bedroom upstairs has direct access to a private deck in the trees overlooking the stream to enjoy your morning beverage or afternoon quiet respite.  The master bathroom upstairs has been newly renovated and has a spacious, tiled shower.  Towels and robes provided.  \n\nThe loft contains the second sleeping area with two extra long twin beds, and half bath that includes new washer and dryer.    \n\nNo matter what season you come to visit,  whether it's for the spring meadows laced with wild flowers, the smells and activities of summer,  the magnificence of autumn colors, or a blanket of the greatest snow on earth, every season invites you to return and stay one more time.  Make this your come back to destination.",
