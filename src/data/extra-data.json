    "description": "The Cottage on the Stream in Sundance, Utah is a Kid Friendly, Pet Friendly, Family Friendly, vacation rental cabin within walking distance of the most magical Mountain Resort in Northern Utah!\nThe meadow and the property are big enough to let the kids roam outside and play. Bring along your well behaved canine companion* and everyone can have a great play day together.\nThe Cottage is a comfortable place to stay with lots of seating, sleeping and space. The living room has two, new La-Z-Boy power leather recliners plus a very comfortable leather couch, and a couch from the 60's that everyone loves.\nThe wood burning, efficient fireplace provides the heat, sights, sounds and scents without all the work of an open fireplace. The kitchen is small but mighty. The window looks directly out onto the stream and the deck. Coffee maker, citrus juicer, griddle for blueberry pancakes, blender, crock pot, pots, pans and dishes are all provided. Spices and pantry essentials are also provided.\nThe family room has a trundle bed plus a sleeper sofa and is a great place to watch a movie under the snugglies. A table for eating or playing games, plus a cabinet of books, movies, puzzles and games will keep everyone entertained. Lots of windows let in natural light so you feel like you are living outdoors and the back door leads right to the redwood deck. The entire upstairs area is devoted to sleeping locations. The Queen's Space has a queen bed of course and a window that overlooks the stream and allows the sounds of the stream to lull you to sleep.\nThe middle section is affectionately called the Bedroom of the Six Dwarfs. Six twin beds are arranged so kids and not so little kids can be close enough for midnight whispers but not so close that they are cramped.\nThe King Den features a king size bed, a rocking chair by the window and a baby crib if needed. Two windows bring in the morning sun, the nighttime moon and the sounds of the stream.\nThe new redwood deck with the top rail designed for dining, plus the tables and chairs give everyone space to eat together or meander around while dinner is cooking on the propane grill.\nFive minutes away by car or a short walk will have you at Sundance Resort (no affiliation). Ski slopes, spa, zip line, full moon lift rides, restaurants, evening entertainment at the Owl Bar with live music on the weekends provides the opportunity to check back in when you want.

    "description": "Down a private winding road, past the horse pasture and around the bend, you will find the Treehouse on the Stream - the essence of mountain lodging in Sundance, Utah.\nA perfect stream-side spot for your Rustic, Mountain Wedding or Family Reunion.** The Treehouse has two separate levels with their own entrances so it functions well for couples traveling together or for kids who want their own space. The upper level has beds for five and a sleeper sofa for two more, a real wood burning fireplace, a fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, televisions with satellite service and large windows to bring the forest inside.\nThe kitchen deck invites you to enjoy your morning beverage outside in the quiet while watching the birds on the feeder. The main deck allows for dining al fresco overlooking the stream or watching the stars at night.\nThe lower level has a separate entrance and a gas fireplace with a thermostat and remote control. The living room features a cozy, comfortable sleeper sofa where itâ€™s fun to watch a movie on HD TV.\nThe big windows look out onto the deck and lawn. The kitchenette area is equipped with a mini fridge and toaster/convection oven. The queen size bed sits beside a large window and looks out into the forest at ground level. Great for catching the squirrels at play, wild turkeys on their daily treks and even deer that wander close to the house.\nGot kids needing their own space? This is it. Check out the trap door with ladder for going upstairs and down. Kids love this! The lower level deck has a porch swing for watching the kids swing or play in their own tree house.\nTrails meander through the property or to take you up the hills and into the woods for exploring. Thereâ€™s room to throw a ball, play hide and seek or just find a rock to sit on - you can do it all at the Tree House property.\nFive minutes away by car or a short walk will have you at Sundance Resort. Ski slopes, spa, zip line, full moon lift rides, restaurants, evening entertainment at the Owl Bar with live music on the weekends provides the opportunity to check back in when you want. As is typical for all Utah winter mountains driving, access requires 4-wheel drive & all weather or snow specific tires & chains on a 2-wheel drive vehicle.\n**Event Fees apply.",

    "description": "TimpCreek on the Stream is convenient to both nature and amenities and is the perfect choice for a romantic getaway or for the business traveler. Once you arrive, you can park, unload and then forget the car. An easy 3 minute walk by the creek and through the trees brings you to the base of the ski lift, the restaurants, the bar, gift shop, art gallery, meeting rooms or by going in the opposite direction up the stairs, is the Spa. This is where you want to be.\nWe are a privately owned and operated vacation property within the Sundance Resort. Although we are not affiliated with the Resort itself, all activities and amenities are available for your use.\nTimpCreek is not a private stand alone structure and has another rental attached to it. Each unit has itâ€™s own very separate private entrance and all TimpCreekâ€™s decks and space are wholly yours to use.\nTime away is so very important and we commit to do everything to make your time stressfree.\nPrior to your arrival we make sure to not only make TimpCreek on the Stream is comfortable inside but will provide any information you need prior to your arrival.\nAfter your booking, Pamela, your mountain contact, will send you a text for easier comminication and to make sure that any time an urgent message during your stay, we can reach you.\nAs you walk out the path from the cabin, turn left and and on your walk to the Resort, you have two options, both same distance. When you get to the fork, go left and you will pass the Glass Blowers (seasonal), and the Art Gallery for great gifts or drop in and sign up for any of their classes such as pottery, jewelry making, journal making or shop for great gifts.\nTurn right at the fork, and you wll walk past the Private Screening Room, the pond with beautiful 18â€³ inch trout and then walk over to the base of the Outlaw Ski Lift.\nFor a visit to the Spa, as you come out of the cabin turn to your right and walk up the stairs to Timphaven Road. The Spa is located just a short walk on the right side of Timphaven.\nUpon arrival at TimpCreek, the building will be to your right and your disignated parking spot is the one to the right. There is room for one car. Should you need an additional space, please contact your host.\nHand peeled logs, rustic beams, cozy fireplace, timber planked floors, and is so quaint and full of fun collections reflective of Sundance plus the warmth of furnishings from a time long past welcome you to this 2 bedroom, 2.5 bath santuary. Set apart, but not remote, TimpCreek on the Stream has easy all year access.\nCurl up in front of the fireplace for a cozy conversation or to read a book. Prepare a meal in the kitchen, dine at the adjacent dining room table, or work at the desk for doing a bit of business before going out to play.\nOnce you arrive, you are walking distance to the Resorts amenities. However, should you want to explore off mountain you will want to rent or drive a car. Be mindful from November 1st until March 31st you will need to drive a four wheel or all wheel vehicle.\nThere are no grocery stores or gas stations at Sundance however in the directions, we give the location of the stores closest to us.",

    "description": "Updated but true to that traditional charm that will take you back to when you were a kid visiting Grandpa's mountain cabin. Located in a resort that takes you back to a time when fun was plentiful, lift lines were minimal or non-existent, and nature was more valuable than electronics.\nLocated along the historic Paiute Trail in Utahâ€™s Tushar Mountains, in the Eagle Point Ski Resort off of Hwy 153, our Mountain Cabins Utah Condos are true diamonds in the most spectacular rough!\nOur Snowflake #17 is a beautiful ski-in/ski-out 2 bedroom, plus loft, two-bath condo that sleeps 11 people. 2 Queen beds, 5 Twin beds upstairs in the loft and a sleeper sofa for 2 in the living room. Internet access, satellite TV plus a Blu-ray player is there for you to make your stay more enjoyable and comfortable. A real wood-burning fireplace with dry wood and fire starters makes things extra cozy and convenient. Thereâ€™s floor space for an extra person should they want to bring a sleeping bag.\nA fully stocked kitchen provides everything you need to make yourself at homeâ€”cooking utensils, silverware, pots & pans, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, pizza pan, wine glasses, coffee maker, toaster, blender, dishwasher, and microwave. Youâ€™ll find a starter supply of paper towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap and trash bags for your use. Look for the charging station in the kitchen to keep your mobile devices charged and ready to go.\nThe deck has plenty of room to sit outside and enjoy spectacular views of the ski slopes and breathe the clean air with a nice cup of coffee in the morning or a beverage of choice in the evening to watch the sunset or look at the stars.",
